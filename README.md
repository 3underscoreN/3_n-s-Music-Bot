# MusicBot (Discord Bot) made by 3_n#7069.

## Introduction
This is a bot I write in my free time. As bots like Groovy and Rythm are taken down by YouTube and bots my friends use (ProBot) has poor connectivity in
our region, I decided to write a bot. 

This is also my first time tracking project with git, please feel free to use and modify my code and teach me how to write python/ use git and Github (If you happpen
to find this project as a stranger. :P)

## Dependencies
You would need these python packages before you can run this program:
* `disnake`
* `pafy`
* `PyNaCl`
* `youtube-dl`
* `youtube-search`

Run the following to install these dependencies:
```
$ pip install disnake pafy PyNaCl youtube-dl youtube-search
```
---
Apart from that, you also need to setup your own bot in [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers).

## Deployment
Setup two environment variables:
* `OWNER`: Owner's ID
* `TOKEN`: Your bot's token

Run `main.py` after cloning the project.
